## Built with

## Project Overview
This was my first project using React. I realise React may be overkill for such a small project but I wanted to start working with React to get a feel for State and Props.

### Things I learned
1. ES6 Syntax - specifically Template Literals and Classes
2. React Syntax and the the use of State and Props 
3. Passing Data between Componenents using Props
4. Using callBack funtions
4. Learning how components are re-rendered after any state change
5. The difference between Stateless functional componenents and Class based components (state)

### Challenges
1. Passing data between comonents
2. Styling - difficulty maintain a consistent Best Practice
